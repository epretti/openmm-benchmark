Script to automatically download and install OpenMM build dependencies, build
OpenMM from source, then run the OpenMM benchmark suite and save the results.

Can run with:

curl -LOf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epretti/openmm-benchmark/refs/heads/master/openmm-benchmark.sh && chmod +x openmm-benchmark.sh && ./openmm-benchmark.sh

Arguments are passed on from openmm-benchmark.sh to OpenMM's benchmark.py, so,
e.g., you can run a multi-GPU benchmark by replacing ./openmm-benchmark.sh with

./openmm-benchmark.sh "--test=amber20-cellulose,amber20-stmv --device=0,1,..."

(Use the actual device indices for the GPUs you want to benchmark.)  Arguments
to pass should be quoted into a single argument; if multiple arguments are given
to the script, benchmark.py will be run multiple times.  This can be useful to
perform multiple sets of benchmarks at once with different settings.  If no
arguments are given at all, benchmarks will be run once with default options.

Run analyze.py with JSON files output by the benchmark script as arguments to
summarize benchmark results.
